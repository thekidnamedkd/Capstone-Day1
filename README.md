#### Notes & Blurbs for Presentation

* _"I chose Gatsby to quickly bootstrap a project within a React framework by combining the speed and convenience of GraphQL with a basic frontend."_
* _"I found the GraphCMS ecommerce starter within Gatsby to take advantage of this bootstrap while embracing the Content Mesh of microservices including Stripe, Postmark, and Printful to quickly spin up a proof of concept."_

#### API's and Microservices

- **[GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com)**: Localised product content, reviews, and order management.
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**: Used to securely process payments and Strong Customer Authentication.
- **[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)**: Statically build product pages and handle cart/checkout logic.
- **[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com)**: Deliver order received and dispatched email notifications to customers.
- **[Printful](https://printful.com)**: Create inventory and drop ship with ease.
